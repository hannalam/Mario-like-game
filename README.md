OVERVIEW

The final stage of your game project is to make your game awesome. 

Extensions
Complete two out of four possible extensions shown below.

1. Add advanced graphics

Make your graphics as pretty as possible. We don't think you need tutorials for this.

2. Add sound

Use p5.sound to add sound effects to your game. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this.

3. Create platforms

Use the factory pattern to create platforms. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this.

4. Create enemies

Use a constructor function to create enemies. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this.

Make your code awesome
Secondly, review your code and make sure it is awesome. This means:

1. Make sure your code is well formatted. If you're unsure how to do this, then rewatch the code philosophy video "The elegant coder".

2. Make sure that you have used variables, objects and functions well. The code philosophy lecture, "The elegant coder" can also provide help for this area.

3. Make sure your code works as well as can be. Iron out those bugs. Code philosophy videos "The debugger's mindset" and "Testing" will help you in your approach to this.

Deliverables
Hand in your final game project as a zipped folder containing:

*your final game project code
*all assets needed to run the code (html files, library files, images, sound files etc).

For each of your two extensions, write a comment of around 150 words at the top of your code explaining:

*your extension
*the bits you found difficult
*the skills you learnt/practised by implementing it
